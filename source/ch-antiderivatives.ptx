  <title>Antiderivatives</title>

  <introduction>
    <p> 
      Calculus 1 was about the process of <em>differentiation</em> and its applications.
      Recall that differentiation is the process of finding the <em>derivative</em> of a function.
      The derivative of a function <m>f</m> is another function <m>f'</m>, which gives the <em>rate of change</em> of <m>f</m> at every point.
    </p>

    <p>
      We start Calculus 2 by thinking about the reverse process to differentiation.
      That is, given a function <m>f</m>,
      we wish to find a function <m>F</m> whose derivative is <m>f</m>.
      Such a function <m>F</m> is called an <em>antiderivative</em> of <m>f</m>, 
      and the process of finiding an antiderivative is called <em>antidifferentiation</em>.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Why do we care about antidifferentiation?
      Because antiderivatives are useful.
      <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                Perhaps we know the (variable) velocity of an object that is moving in a straight line, and wish to know its position at a certain time.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Perhaps we know the rate of change of the number of daily users of an app, and wish to determine the number of daily users at a given time in the future.
            </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      Essentially, if we have a function that describes the rate of change of a certain quantity, then we can take an antiderivative to determine the function that describes that quantity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Antiderivatives also turn out to be useful in some much more surprising situations.
      For instance, they can be used 
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            to compute areas and volumes of various shapes and solids;
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            to compute the probabilities of certain random events in statistics; and
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            to compute quantities like displacement and work done in physics.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      The connection between antiderivatives and these problems is a surprising result called the <em>Fundamental Theorem of Calculus</em>, which we will study in <xref ref="ch-definite-integrals" />.
