  <title>Initial Value Problems</title>

  <p>
    Suppose that we know the derivative <m>f'</m> of some function <m>f</m>.
    Then we know that <m>f</m> is <em>some</em> antiderivative of <m>f'</m>.
    But which one is it?  The function <m>f'</m> has many different antiderivatives, corresponding to different constants of integration.
    If we also know some <em>initial value</em> of <m>f</m>, such as <m>f(0)</m>, then we can determine <m>f(x)</m> for all <m>x</m> (as long as <m>f</m> is continuous). 
  </p>

  <example>
    <title>An Initial Value Problem</title>
  
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose that <m>f'(x)=3x^2</m> and <m>f(0)=1</m>.  Find <m>f(x)</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>

    <answer>
      <p>
        <m>
          f(x)=x^3+1
        </m>
      </p>
    </answer>

    <solution>
      <p>
        Antidifferentiating, we find
        <men xml:id="eqn-ivp">
          f(x)=x^3+C
        </men>
        for some constant <m>C</m>.  
      </p>

      <p>
        In order to find <m>C</m>, we use our initial value <m>f(0)=1</m>.
        Substituting <m>x=0</m> on both sides of <xref ref="eqn-ivp"/>, we find <m>C=1</m>.  So we conclude that
        <me>
          f(x)=x^3+1.
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        The graphs of several antiderivatives of <m>f'</m> are drawn in <xref ref="fig-ivp"/>.  
        Note that <m>f(x)=x^3+1</m> (drawn in red) is the only antiderivative that goes through the point <m>(0,1)</m>, 
        i.e., it is the only antiderivative whose value at <m>0</m> is <m>1</m>.

      Another Initial Value Problem
    </title>
    
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose that <m>g''(x)=\frac{-3}{x^2}</m>, and that <m>g'(1)=2</m> and <m>g(1)=0</m>.  Find <m>g(x)</m> for all <m>x>0</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>

    <answer>
      <p>
        <m>
          g(x)=3\ln(x)-x+1 \ \ \text{for all } x>0.
        </m>
      </p>
    </answer>

    <solution>
      <p>
        Throughout, we assume that <m>x>0</m>, so that we do not have to worry about the fact that <m>g''(x)</m> is undefined at <m>x=0</m>.
        Note that <m>g''(x)=-3x^{-2}</m>, so antidifferentiating gives
        <me>
          g'(x)= 3x^{-1}+C,
        </me>
        or equivalently
        <men xml:id="eqn-ivp-twice">
          g'(x)=\frac{3}{x}+C,
        </men>
        where <m>C</m> is some constant.  Since <m>g'(1)=2</m>, substituting <m>x=1</m> into <xref ref="eqn-ivp-twice"/> gives
        <me>
          2=3+C,
        </me>
        which we solve to find <m>C=-1</m>.  So we have <m>g'(x)=\frac{3}{x}-1</m> for all <m>x>0</m>.      
      </p>

      <p>
        Antidifferentiating once more, we find
        <men xml:id="eqn-ivp-twice-again">
          g(x)=3\ln(x)-x+D,
        </men>
        where <m>D</m> is some constant.  
        (Note that it is safe to use <m>\ln(x)</m> instead of <m>\ln|x|</m> here, since <m>x>0</m>.)
        Since <m>g(1)=0</m>, substituting <m>x=1</m> into <xref ref="eqn-ivp-twice-again" /> gives
        <me>
          0=3\ln(1)-1+D
        </me>
        Since <m>\ln(1)=0</m>, we find <m>D=1</m>.  So we conclude that <m>g(x)=3\ln(x)-x+1</m> for all <m>x>0</m>.

    Recall that if <m>s(t)</m> describes the position of an object moving in a straight line at time <m>t</m>, 
    then the <em>velocity</em> of the object at time <m>t</m> is given by
    <me>
      v(t)=s'(t),
    </me>
    and the <em>acceleration</em> of the object at time <m>t</m> is given by
    <me>
      a(t)=v'(t).

    <title>Throwing Stones</title>
    
    <statement>
      <p>
        Lucas is visiting Spahats Creek Falls in Wells Gray Provincial Park.  
        He throws a stone straight up off the edge of the viewing platform with an initial velocity of <m>12\text{m}/\text{s}</m>, 
        and watches it fall to the bottom of the canyon, which is <m>80\text{m}</m> below the platform.
        Let <m>s(t)</m> be the height of the stone, measured in metres above the bottom of the canyon, after <m>t</m> seconds.

      </p>
    </answer>

    <solution>
      <p>
        Let <m>v(t)</m> and <m>a(t)</m> represent the velocity and the acceleration of the stone, respectively.
        We know that <m>v(t)=s'(t)</m>, and <m>a(t)=s''(t)</m>.
        Since acceleration due to gravity is a constant <m>-9.8\text{m}/\text{s}^2</m>, we have
        <me>
          a(t)=-9.8.
        </me>
        Antidifferentiating, we find
        <men xml:id="ivp-velocity">
          v(t)=-9.8t+C,
        </men>
        where <m>C</m> is some constant.  
        Since the stone is thrown with an initial velocity of <m>12\text{m}/\text{s}</m>, we must have <m>v(0)=12</m>.
        Substituting <m>t=0</m> into <xref ref="ivp-velocity"/>, we find <m>C=12</m>.  Therefore, we have
        <me>
          v(t)=-9.8t+12.
        </me>
        Antidifferentiating again, we find
        <men xml:id="ivp-acceleration">
          s(t)=-4.9t^2+12t+D,
        </men>
        where <m>D</m> is some constant.  
        Since the stone in thrown from an initial height of <m>80\text{m}</m>, we must have <m>s(0)=80</m>.
        Substituting <m>t=0</m> into <xref ref="ivp-acceleration"/>, we find <m>D=80</m>.  Therefore, we have
        <me>
          s(t)=-4.9t^2+12t+80.
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        For part (b), we must solve <m>s(t)=0</m>.  
        Using the quadratic formula, we find two solutions: <m>t_1\approx 5.45</m> and <m>t_2\approx -3.00</m>.
        Of course, in the context of this problem, only the positive solution makes sense.  
        (Remember that the stone is not thrown until time <m>t=0</m>.)
        So we conclude that the stone hits the bottom of the canyon approximately <m>5.45</m> seconds after it is thrown.
      </p>

      <p>
        For part (c), we substitute the solution <m>t_1\approx 5.45</m> into the velocity function:
        <me>
          v(t_1)=-9.8t_1+12\approx -43.38.
        </me>
        So the stone is travelling at a speed of approximately <m>43.38</m> metres per second when it hits the bottom of the canyon.

    The initial value problems that we studied in this section belong to an area of mathematics called <em>differential equations</em>.
    A <em>differential equation</em> is an equation that involves one or more derivatives of a function <m>f</m>.
    Given a differential equation involving derivatives of a function <m>f</m>, and possibly some other information about <m>f</m>, the goal is to describe the function <m>f</m> itself.
    We will see more differential equations in <xref ref="ch-differential-equations"/>.
